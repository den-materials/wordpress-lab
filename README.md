# Wordpress Lab

Now that we've learned a little bit about Wordpress, we're going to make a website for **INSERT PERSON HERE**!

Everyone needs a website - even if they don't know it yet! Your job is to find someone who needs a site, and make them a working rough draft. You'll need to collect information on what they want, and deliver a working prototype that they can review!

If you can't find a person who wants a website, you can make a fictional website for a pretend client. 


To get started:
1. Study the requests of your new client - make a list or scope doc. Anything format works - just make sure you've gathered all neccssary materials! 
2. Find a theme that you think will fit the bill, or hack at the one pre-installed by Wordpress.
3. Set up as much of the site as you can in the time you have. Keep in mind that Wordpress was designed so that non-technical people can update their websites - so, you should stay away from hardcoded pages, or large chuncks of HTML in the admin section. Work **with** Wordpress to maintain non-techinical usability.
4. Host your wordpress instance on [Heroku](https://ksylvest.com/posts/2014-05-02/deploying-wordpress-to-heroku) or your own hosting account so that your client can see it. I suggest using [Duplicator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/) to easily move your WP instance from one host to another.

## Assignment

Submit a link to your live WP instance. 

You are not expected to deliver a fully-functional finished product - all I want is **a live Wordpress instance that has enough of your client's requests that you can demo it to them**.
