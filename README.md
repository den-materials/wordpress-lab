# Wordpress Lab

Now that we've learned a little bit about Wordpress, we're going to make a website for your lightning talk!

What better way to present your research work than with a research project of its own--one into the basic features of Wordpress?

You will need to use this Wordpress site as a major component of your lightning talk visual aids.

You will need three of the following pieces to bring your Wordpress presentation piece to life:

1. At least two "pages", i.e. fully separate single HTML pages
2. An image gallery with at least 3 images
3. A plugin
4. At least two "posts", i.e. modular pieces of HTML
5. Add or customize a header and footer for your theme
6. Host your wordpress instance on [Heroku](https://ksylvest.com/posts/2014-05-02/deploying-wordpress-to-heroku) or your own hosting account so that your client can see it. I suggest using [Duplicator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/) to easily move your WP instance from one host to another.

## Assignment

There are two options here: **hard mode** and **easy mode**.

### Hard Mode

Use the setup steps from the last lesson to create a local Wordpress site.  Then complete step 6 above to deploy your site.

### Easy Mode

Go to http://www.wordpress.com.  Set up a new account, and create your first site.  You will see a lot of similar options from the last class, but not all of them.

### Wrapping Up

Whether you follow the easy mode or hard mode path, submit a link to your live WP instance to #wdi6 after you finish your Lightning Talk.

Your instructional team will gather all these links into a repo, and share with the class.

Don't worry too much about perfecting your Wordpress site.  All we want to see is the work you put into your Lightning Talk in a convenient format.  The talk itself, and the project you build, are the more important parts.
